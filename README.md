This repository mainly contains `klausurvorbereitung_sml.qmd`, a markdown file with the provided questions as well as some other examples. I tried to code everything from scratch and provide helpful tipps.

I'm not a computer science student however and used R for everything – not Python like it's used in the lecture. You can use R and RStudio to open and run it.

To view a nicely rendered output, download or clone this repository and open `output/klausurvorbereitung_sml.html` with your browser. `Klausurvorbereitung SML.pdf` contains a PDF version of the website (but doesn't look as nice).
