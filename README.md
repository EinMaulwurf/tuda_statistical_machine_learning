This repository mainly contains `klausurvorbereitung_sml.qmd`, a markdown file with the provided questions as well as some other examples. I tried to code everything from scratch and provide helpful tipps.

I'm not a computer science student however and used R for everything – not Python like it's used in the lecture. You can use R and RStudio to open and run it.

To view a nicely rendered output, download or clone this repository and open `klausurvorbereitung_sml.html` with your browser. For everything to work, the `klausurvorbereitung_sml_files/` and `pictures/` subdirectories must be in the same folder as the html file.
